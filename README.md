# The FROG (v.4)

## What is FROG?

## Why FROG?
The FROG (Flexible and pROGrammable router) is a project started at the Computer Networks group of Politecnico di Torino back in 2012. Since then, the project evolved with different incarnations and has now become a cloud/NFV orchestrator. Hence, the original name, which include the term 'router' is no longer appropriate, but we keep this name to remind us where this project comes from.
